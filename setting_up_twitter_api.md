# Setting Up Twitter API

To use Tweepy,  which is needed for a project in this course, you will need to set up a Twitter API account.

First, go to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com). Make sure you have a Twitter account set up and "Sign in". Click the "Create New App" button as shown below (Figure 1).

After that, fill in the form to create an API account. Give any name you like, and provide a "Website" if you have one you own. Otherwise, just use a placeholder as I've done below. It does not have to be an existing site (Figure 2).

After that, your API account will be set up. You will see the page below. Click the "Manage Keys and Access Tokens" link (Figure 3).

You will then come to a page to manage your keys and tokens, which you will need to have so Tweepy can use this account. Note the "Consumer Key" and "Consumer Secret" values. You will need those. Then click "Create my access token".

**Figure 4:** Note the values above, and click "Create my access token"

A panel will pop up at the bottom with two more values: "Access Token" and "Access Token Secret". Hold on to these two values as well (Figure 5).

Do not share these four key/token values as they are used to access your Twitter API account. Be sure to follow the usage agreement so your access is not revoked.
